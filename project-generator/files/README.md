## About
This project was generated from Playground living here:
[Project ##PROJECT-ID##](##PROJECT-LINK##)

We have added some basics tests, which you can run using Node, Flow Emulator and Flow JS Testing Framework.

## Installation
### Node *(optional if you have it installed already)*
Please follow instructions on NodeJS download page and install latest version of NodeJS software:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Flow Emulator *(optional if you have it installed already)*
Flow Emulator is bundled with Flow CLI. You can find instructions on how to install it on Flow Docs site:
https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/

### Flow JS Testing Framework
All the necessary files will be installed if you run `npm install` inside `test` folder

### Next Step
When all the above tools would be installed you will need to inti flow emulator with `flow init` command from withing 
`test` folder. This will create `flow.json` file in the folder, which is necessary for emulator to operate properly

### Afterword
Good luck and happy hacking! :)
